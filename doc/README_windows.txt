Intro
-----
EmerCoin is a free open source project derived from Emercoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Emercoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
After completing windows setup then run emercoin-qt.
Alternatively you can run windows command line (cmd) in emercoin program dir.
  cd daemon
  emercoind
You would need to create a configuration file emercoin.conf in the default
wallet directory. Grant access to emercoind/emercoin-qt in anti-virus and firewall
applications if necessary.

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 6661 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  EmerCoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the EmerCoin network.
